## PROGRAM - TWO SUM
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.

## OUTPUT
Output: [2,7,11,15] , Target =9 
[0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

## PROGRAM - PALINDROME
Given an integer x, return true if x is a 
palindrome, and false otherwise.

## OUTPUT : TRUE
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

## PROGRAM - REVERSED INTEGER
Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then return 0.

## OUTPUT
Output: 321

## PROGRAM - TWO STRING
write a program to check whether a number is equal to the reverse of the same number.
123 = 321 PASS
456 = 134 FAIL 
sounds easy right? here's the catch:the number should not be convereted to string.

## OUTPUT 
123 = FAIL
456 = FAIL
